## Project Description
This project utilizes Power Query and DAX measures to analyze Adventure Works Cycles, a fictional manufacturing company. Through interactive dashboards, it offers insights into sales performance, product trends, and customer behavior. The "Exec Summary" dashboard presents key metrics like revenue, orders, and geographic sales. The "Product Detail" and "Customer Detail" dashboards focus on product-specific and customer-centric analyses, aiding in data-driven decision-making.

## Lessons Learned 
**Technology Challenges**

Throughout the course of this project, we encountered and successfully navigated various technology challenges while conducting a comprehensive analysis of the AdventureWorks Database. Noteworthy technology challenges included:

- **Data Modeling and Relationship:** Building a robust data model with meticulously defined relationships, primary keys, and foreign keys proved instrumental in ensuring precise analysis and deriving meaningful insights.

- **Schema Optimization:** Skillful organization of the database schema played a pivotal role in streamlining data manipulation and retrieval processes, contributing significantly to the project's overall effectiveness.

- **DAX Mastery:** Proficient utilization of Data Analysis Expressions (DAX) functions, including filtering, conditional statements (IF), rolling functions, year-to-date (YTD) calculations, and comparisons with previous months, was essential for calculating essential Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) that facilitated comprehensive performance evaluation.

- **What-If Analysis:** Skillfully conducting what-if analysis, especially concerning price adjustments, provided a deeper understanding of potential impacts on revenue and profitability, furnishing vital insights for informed decision-making.

**Business Insights**

The data analysis journey yielded insightful revelations that shed light on Adventure Works Cycles' operational dynamics:
